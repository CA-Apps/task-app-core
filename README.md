# task-app-core
Sample using Tasks in C# using Microsoft .NET Core 2.0

This is a console application that demonstrates using Tasks in C#
in Microsoft .NET Core 2.0. This project uses the API from
https://github.com/jeremybytes/person-api-core (default 
location: http://localhost:9874/api/people).

To run the console application, use `dotnet run` from the project folder. 
The current behavior is to output "One Moment Please", pause 3 seconds,
then print out a list of names.

Press the `Return` key to exit the console application.

Articles describing this project are forth-coming.
